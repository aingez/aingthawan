    description: [
      "Ever since I was young, I've been drawn to tinkering, modding, and exploring new technologies. My innate curiosity has led me down many fascinating paths, from the joy of classic 35mm film photography to the challenge of building my own Voron 2.4 350 3D printer from scratch.",
      "This technical passion also inspired me to pursue a computer engineering degree, as I'm captivated by the rapid digital transformation happening across industries. I'm eager to apply my skills in fields like embedded systems, IoT, and networking - in fact, I'm currently seeking an internship opportunity to put my knowledge into practice.",
      "Beyond the technical realm, I have diverse interests that bring balance to my life. I cherish quiet moments at home, especially on a rainy day, and I'm particularly fond of the film 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.' I'm also drawn to realms of sustainability, solarpunk design, and the frontiers of robotics. And when it comes to sports, I enjoy the thrill of rally racing, the serenity of freediving, and the focus of tactical shooting.",
      "Whether tinkering, exploring the great outdoors, or simply reflecting on life's simple pleasures, I approach each day with a spirit of curiosity and a desire to grow. I invite you to delve into my resume and project portfolio to learn more about my background and passions."
